# fifty-states
This is the first portion of information on the fifty states. It's designed to
not output a file unless the user can answer all the questions correctly. If
the user is sent back to the beginning if a question is missed. This could be
changed; however, it is built this way so that attention to detail is deemed
important and to increase the chances to commit to memory the facts and figures
on each of the fifty states.
